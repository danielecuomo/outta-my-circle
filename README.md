# OUTTA_MY_CIRCLE
Outta My Circle is a project that aims to develop an Android game prototype. The ultimate goal is to acquire Game Design and Development skills.

The game features several rounds in which the goal is to defeat opponents by knocking them out from the arena. The last player standing wins the round. At the end of all the rounds, each player can win, lose or draw. When you select a skin, you can't play with other players with the same skin. You can also select an attack which can help you to defeat your opponents; after attacking, you have to wait a little bit before you can attack again. That's all. Ah, remember: Outta My Circle!
